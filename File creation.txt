This document explains how to prepare file to work with this program.
Each file contains 3 different lists.
1st list is a list of vertices including coordinates of each vertice.
2nd list is a list of indices including vertices making up each indice.
3rd list contains RGB color value of saved figure.

Below is an example of how saved file should look:
vertice1 " vertice2 " vertice3 # indice1 " indice2 " indice3 # color
# is a symbol that splits string into main lists of vertices, indices and color.
" is a symbol that splits each of the main lists into sublists of coordinates.

Sublists of vertices, indices and color are separated by spaces, so:
eg. vertice1 = 1.0 1.0 1.0
eg. indice1 = 1 2 3

Vertices and color are saved as float values, while indices are integers.
